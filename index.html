				<h1>WebGL Doom</h1>
				<p>...but not really, well at least not at the moment anyway. What we have here is
					a WebGL renderer for displaying Doom Levels loaded directly from the Shareware
					Wad file. This demo uses a <a href="http://glbsp.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">GLBSP</a>
					modified version of the original wad file can be downloaded from
					<a href="ftp://ftp.idsoftware.com/idstuff/doom/" target="_blank">the official
					id software ftp</a> to make it more WebGL/OpenGL friendly.</p>
				<p>While Doom may not look very complicated by todays standards there are quite a
					few issues trying to render its data in an accellerated 3D enviroment, so there
					is plently of little hacks and bodges along the way. Which you can try and
					decipher from the spaghetti code at
					<a href="https://github.com/HeavyIndustries/webgldoom" target="_blank">
					https://github.com/HeavyIndustries/webgldoom</a>. At some point we plan to
					do a technical write up on how we got to this stage.</p>
				<p>This demo uses the excellent <a href="https://github.com/vjeux/jDataView"
					target="_blank">jDataView.js</a> binary file reader we can pull out all the map
					and texture	information from the wad file then construct the data into a
					WebGL buffer. The rendering framework behind this demo is using our custom
					built WebGL	engine <a href="https://github.com/HeavyIndustries/he3d"
					target="_blank">he3d</a> which we'll not go into, its not important to this
					demo, it just hides a lot of the html5/webgl/javascript gumpf away.</p>

				<h2>24th December 2012 Update:</h2>
				<p>THINGS! (Doom's name for the 2d sprites you see on the map).
					These are now rendering in their spawnstate and don't animate or move yet, that
					will probably be the next stage. They also always face the camera, which is
					correct but not the best way of drawing them. Ideally they would only rotate on
					one axis, if you fly the camera above and look down you will notice they are
					flat on the ground. This is the Mario64 way of billboarding.</p>					
					
				<h2>The Demo</h2>
				<p>Yeah yeah yeah, enough with the technical nonsense, click on one of the links
					below to have a play around with it. Bare in mind that most of the maps don't
					render correctly and some may even cause errors and stop it from running but
					its still pretty fun to fly around</p>

				<h2>Controls</h2>
				<p>If you have a recent version of <a href="www.google.com/chrome" target="_blank">
					Chrome</a> you should have access to the <a target="_blank"
					href="http://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/mouse-lock">Pointer
					Lock API</a>, click on the main view port and you should get a small popup at
					the top of the screen asking you to allow mouse lock. This is a good thing...<br>
					If you don't have a fancy new version of Chrome, you can use the cursor keys to
					move your view around.</p>
				<p>Other than that its your basic WASD style control scheme, you can use the Q and E
					keys to float up and down. Yeah yeah, Doom didn't have up and down, it didn't
					even have looking up and down but for the sake of this demo and to save my sanity
					while developing this, you can.</p>
				<p>There are a few other buttons you can fiddle with too, if your GPU is halfway
					decent you can try maximising the viewport using ALT+RETURN, then if you are
					feeling really fruity, hit F11 for full screen browser mode.</p>
				<p>You can also toggle some of the rendering settings using 1,2,3,4,5. It should be
					fairly obvious what they do when you press them, the 'Things' are the positions
					where monsters/barrels/2d objects would be (not quite got them working yet).</p>

				<h2>Disclaimer</h2>
				<p>We can't be held responsible for the quality of the code in this demo, we wrote
					it ourselves and that should be enough of a warning for you. Sorry if it burns
					down your cat or kicks your house, we didn't intend it to but these things just
					tend to happen.</p>
				<p>With this being Doom and all, we are also not responsible if you go on a mass
					killing spree apparently that happens when you play video games.</p>
