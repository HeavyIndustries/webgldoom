				<h1>WebGL Doom</h1>
				<p>...but not really, well at least not at the moment anyway. What we have here is
					a WebGL renderer for displaying Doom Levels loaded directly from the Shareware
					Wad file. This demo uses a <a href="http://glbsp.sourceforge.net/"
					target="_blank">GLBSP</a> modified version of the original wad file can be
					downloaded from
					<a href="ftp://ftp.idsoftware.com/idstuff/doom/" target="_blank">the official
					id software ftp</a> to make it more WebGL/OpenGL friendly.</p>
				<p>While Doom may not look very complicated by todays standards there are quite a
					few issues trying to render its data in an accellerated 3D enviroment, so there
					is plently of little hacks and bodges along the way. Which you can try and
					decipher from the spaghetti code at
					<a href="https://github.com/HeavyIndustries/webgldoom" target="_blank">
					https://github.com/HeavyIndustries/webgldoom</a>. At some point we plan to
					do a technical write up on how we got to this stage.</p>
				<p>This demo uses the excellent <a href="https://github.com/vjeux/jDataView"
					target="_blank">jDataView.js</a> binary file reader we can pull out all the map
					and texture	information from the wad file then construct the data into a
					WebGL buffer. The rendering framework behind this demo is using our custom
					built WebGL	engine <a href="https://github.com/HeavyIndustries/he3d"
					target="_blank">he3d</a> which we'll not go into, its not important to this
					demo, it just hides a lot of the html5/webgl/javascript gumpf away.</p>

				<h2 class="update" onclick="toggle(this,'130108')">- 21st Feb 2013 Update:</h2>
				<div id="130221">
					<p>Oops, been awhile since we've updated here.<br>
						- Split game.js into seperate files, much more readable and managable now<br>
						- Updated to latest features in HE3D engine<br>
						- Added HUD/Statusbar stuff.<br>
						- Moved the debug keys to z,x,c,v,etc. The number keys are for weapons*.<br>
						- THINGS angle correctly... mostly<br>
						- THINGS have gained some intelligence now, they'll turn and shoot at you
							if you get close enough.<br>
						- Fixed ALPHA on wall textures<br>
						- Projectiles!<br>
						- Heightmap is gone, using the BSP sector check now.<br>
						- Fixed some missing sprites<br>
						- Reworked lighting, now works on THINGS.<br>
						- Added some parsing code for audio support, not ready for use yet<br>
						- Added animated FLATS<br>
						- Sprite name lookup is way faster now<br>
						- Probably a lot more<br>
						<i>* No you still can't fire the weapons yet =P</i></p>
				</div>
				
				<h2 class="update" onclick="toggle(this,'130108')">- 8th Jan 2013 Update:</h2>
				<div id="130108" style="display:none;">
					<p>Heightmaps should transfer a bit better now as it doesn't try to upload
						the map as a texture (this was crashing Chrome on E1M8).</p>
					<p>Added some better collision detection against the heightmap, its still very
						wrong but at least you shouldn't fall through the world too much now. Also
						moved the players position and movement code into it's own thing instead of
						using the camera. We now have fake gravity and mouse movement.</p>
					<p>Added some visual lines to see which THINGS are being considered for what
						will be collision testing later on. (Press 6 to toggle).</p>
				</div>
				
				<h2 class="update" onclick="toggle(this,'130104')">+ 4th Jan 2013 Update</h2>
				<div id="130104" style="display:none;">
					<p>Heightmaps! Crazy over the top heightmaps to be precise. <em>"Thats not the
						way	Doom did it!"</em>. I thought I'd try out rasterising the FLATS into a
						massive	array for a per-pixel based heightmap. There is a good chance this
						might cripple or crash your browser, I've only really tested it on
						an i7 =P</p>
					<p>As a result, the THINGS are in the right places now and in theory could move
						around (when I get to that stage), in the mean time YOU can walk around in
						there now, I've done some quick thrown together Doom style controls (yes
						disabled looking up and down ;))</p>
					<p>There is no friction for the walls or anything yet, so you will get stuck in
						walls at some angles, hopefully you can back out of them if not, use the
						freecam	mode (F key) to fly out of there</p>
					<p>I've seen Chrome crash a few times on the bigger maps (due to the size of the
						heightmap it needs to transfer back) like E1M8 so ymmv on workyness</p>
				</div>
				
				<h2 class="update" onclick="toggle(this,'121226')">+ 26th Dec 2012 Update</h2>
				<div id="121226" style="display:none;">
					<p>THINGS! are now rendering animated in their spawnstate.</p>
				</div>
				
				<h2 class="update" onclick="toggle(this,'121224')">+ 24th Dec 2012 Update</h2>
				<div id="121224" style="display:none;">
					<p>THINGS! (Doom's name for the 2d sprites you see on the map).
						These are now rendering in their spawnstate and don't animate or move yet,
						that will probably be the next stage. They also always face the camera,
						which is correct but not the best way of drawing them. Ideally they would
						only rotate on one axis, if you fly the camera above and look down you will
						notice they are	flat on the ground. This is the Mario64 way of
						billboarding.</p>
				</div>
				
				<h2>The Demo</h2>
				<p>Yeah yeah yeah, enough with the technical nonsense, click on one of the links
					below to have a play around with it. Bare in mind that most of the maps don't
					render correctly and some may even cause errors and stop it from running but
					its still pretty fun to run around</p>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="doom.html#e1m1">E1M1 - Hanger</a></li>
					<li><a href="doom.html#e1m2">E1M2 - Nuclear Plant</a></li>
					<li><a href="doom.html#e1m3">E1M3 - Toxin Refinery</a></li>
					<li><a href="doom.html#e1m4">E1M4 - Command Control</a></li>
					<li><a href="doom.html#e1m5">E1M5 - Phobos Lab</a></li>
					<li><a href="doom.html#e1m6">E1M6 - Central Processing</a></li>

				</ul>

				<h2>Controls</h2>
				<p>If you have a recent version of <a href="www.google.com/chrome" target="_blank">
					Chrome</a> you should have access to the <a target="_blank"
					href="http://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/mouse-lock">Pointer
					Lock API</a>, click on the main view port and you should get a small popup at
					the top of the screen asking you to allow mouse lock. This is a good thing...<br>
					If you don't have a fancy new version of Chrome, you can use the cursor keys to
					move your view around.</p>
				<p>Other than that its your basic WASD style control scheme, you can use the Q and E
					keys to float up and down. Yeah yeah, Doom didn't have up and down, it didn't
					even have looking up and down but for the sake of this demo and to save my
					sanity while developing this, you can (in freecam mode).</p>
				<p><span class="hl">**NEW**</span> By default you walk around the map now, use the
					F key to toggle noclip / freecam mode (useful when you get stuck in a wall)</p>
				<p>There are a few other buttons you can fiddle with too, if your GPU is halfway
					decent you can try maximising the viewport using ALT+RETURN, then if you are
					feeling really fruity, hit F11 for full screen browser mode.</p>
				<p>You can also toggle some of the rendering settings using z,x,c,v,b,n,m.</p>

				<h2>Disclaimer</h2>
				<p>We can't be held responsible for the quality of the code in this demo, we wrote
					it ourselves and that should be enough of a warning for you. Sorry if it burns
					down your cat or kicks your house, we didn't intend it to but these things just
					tend to happen.</p>
				<p>With this being Doom and all, we are also not responsible if you go on a mass
					killing spree apparently that happens when you play video games.</p>
